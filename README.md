Quantitative Finance - Technical Analysis to VaR uisng Indian Stocks
This repo is not a theoretical book that will explain each and every detail
of each indicator presented. This book centers in applying fnance to the
different indicators to offer a hands-on experience.
This repo does not cover all the aspects of fnance. For example, the
repo is centered in technical, quantitative and risk analysis of the stock
market, but it does not cover each and every avenue. This repo does not
contain options and futures, Montecarlo Simulations and binomial trees.
The reason is that this repo aims to be an introductory to intermediate
level. Considering advanced level there are books far more detailed on
this aspects.
This repo does not aim to explain programming language to the
reader. It explains the easiest way to program a portfolio, a MACD, a
VaR and other fnancial instruments. Also, the code is simple and clean
so that the reader is not overwhelmed by programming. I truly believe
that we can learn to program if we start from the basics and this repo
aims for this.
